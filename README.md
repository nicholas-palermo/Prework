# Pre-work - *Tipsy*

**Tipsy** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Nicholas Palermo**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Implemented a bill splitting feature via a stepper that allows user to choose size of party and subsequently splits the bill by that many people.
- [x] Implemented a Slider to increase functionality by expanding user options by way of allowing the user to choose their own tip percentages.
- [x] Created a rate label to depict the current tip rate chosen via both segmented control and/or slider.
- [x] Created a dedicated calculate button.
- [x] Utilized colors that will adapt for Dark Mode compatability via system preferences.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Teaching myself an entire new language from scratch proved to be a little difficult, and the interface of XCode with the storyboard was a little different than what I have been used to. I ran into a few problems after editing my code, as changes in the names of actions or outlets causes a break between the storyboard and the viewcontroller.swift file. 
There are large differences between Swift and C++, which up until now has been the only language I have experience with. However, given that Swift is a pretty straight forward language, it was easy enough to learn the ropes quick. There are plenty of inherited ideas within Swift, especially with iOS development, for me to learn, but the layout of the environment of XCodes helps out a lot.
